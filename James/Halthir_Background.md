<p>
## Goals
Halthir has one main goal - win the heart of Sylvie. He met her at some high class parties where she was running a con. He saw her and was entranced and had to know more. She rebuffed him as he was of no import to her at the time and she was on the mission. After one of the parties he saw her at, he followed her until he discovered that she wasn't who she was representing but was instead part of a gang.

## Family
Halthir Dasami father is disappointed that he's chosen to run off but his mother still loves him and is trying to persuade his father to not disinherit him.

He is the youngest of his family so he's far from the main heir and his siblings' opinions vary but are less extreme, they don't care too much unless he brings huge disrepute to the family.

Halthir doesn't necessarily want the family money as he's just after love, adventure and excitement.

## Dasami Enterprises

He said he would only be a few weeks away, but now it's been 6.
