# Character creation rules

To create characters, players may use rules *[from these listed source books]*.
Here's how I'm modifying the standard character creation rules from the main SR4A book.

[from these listed source books]: Rules.md

## Build point limit

I'm using a build point limit of **250** instead of 400.

I'm _altering the rule_ which states you may not spend more than half of your build points on attributes.
Instead, you may not spend more than 200 build points on attributes.

## Resource availability

I'm _altering the maximum availability_ rating for starting character resources to **5** instead of 12.
This includes gear, implants and _anything with an availability rating_.
On a case-by-case basis, I could allow one or two items which are slightly above this limit but only by specific approval.
If there is a specific item that you'd like which has an availability above 5 then please ask.

This change reflects that as gangers you will only have access to gear and implants you can source from the streets.
_This is going to severely restrict_ your starting gear and cyber modifications.
For example, there won't be any starting characters who have any form of Wired Reflexes.

## Maximum resources

I am _altering the maximum amount of resources_ that any character may gain from build points to **¥125,000** (25 build points) instead of ¥250,000.
You are playing gang members; they're not wealthy.
