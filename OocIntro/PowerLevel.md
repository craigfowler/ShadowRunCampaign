# Power level & progression

At least at character creation, this is a _low level_ game. Your characters certainly wouldn't refer to themselves as shadow runners.
The starting characters in this game would be considered high-ranking gang members, within a small-time street gang.
Likewise, the level of opposition that you'd expect to face will be similarly scaled-back.
For example, where it comes to your starting characters I'm _not expecting them to have multiple initiative passes 'at will'_.

What I will be doing as the campaign goes on is to be more accommodating of things which allow you to change/improve your character.
For those of you who have an idea of what you'd like your character to look like when they're more powerful, my advice is to take thematically-similar things at character creation.
I'll probably allow you to swap them out or respend later, particularly if you have asked me about it in-advance.

That means that it's worth considering cyberware which you would usually pass-by with a full-power character because the essence cost is too high.
Rank 1 Muscle Replacement is a very attractive implant at this power level.

As characters advance in power, I plan to make it easier than usual to get access to the better stuff without being penalised because of decisions you had to make at character creation.
For example, I am planning to bend the rules on having old cyberware removed and replaced with better implants.
For some characters I'd even be willing to build one-off reasons into the plot which would allow rule-breaking respends.
If you think this is appropriate for your character then _please let me know of your intention_ as soon as you can, so that I can prep for it.

## An example of a rule-breaking respend

_Here's an example of the kind of rule-breaking respend that I expect to allow._

Say you'd like to play a **technomancer**.
I'm acutely aware that technomancers need _a lot_ of build points and there's no way I expect you to be able to create a viable one as a starting character here.

I'd ask you you to begin the game as something that's thematically similar: a normal hacker using hot-sim and probably using implants.
Let me know at character creation that you really wanted to be playing a technomancer and I'll build into the plot a _"magical rule-breaking opportunity"_ for your character to be changed once you've received enough karma.
Something exceptional will happen in the plot of the game and your character will come out of the other side of it as a technomancer, with all implants gone and any lost essence regained (this is usually against the rules).
When that happens I'd like to keep the character's abilities as close to the original as possible, but just using technomancer versions of the hacker abilities.
