# Armour Penetration caps

_This house rule is a slight modification to the Armour Penetration rule on SR4A page 162._

## Armour cannot become negative

This should be obvious and it's merely a clarification. Armour Penetration cannot leave a defender with negative armour.

For example a character with 2 ballistic armour is shot with a weapon which has AP -3. Their effective armour is zero; the extra point of AP is unused.

## Positive AP capped at double the normal armour

On SR4A p162 it states that _positive AP_, such as that conferred by flechette rounds is ineffective if the target is not wearing armour.

I am modifying that very slightly, for situations when the target is very lightly armoured.
The positive AP cannot have a greater effect than doubling the defender's armour before the AP was applied.

For example a character with 2 ballistic armour is shot with flechettes: AP +5. Their effective armour is 4 and not 7; the extra three points of positive AP are ineffective.
