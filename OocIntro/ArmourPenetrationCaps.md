# Armour Penetration caps

_This house rule is a slight modification to the Armour Penetration rule._
The original rule is on **SR4A page 162**.

I think that this is _very unlikely_ to be negative to player characters, unless they are planning on playing low-armour characters who expect to be shot with flechettes.

## Positive AP is capped at doubling the effective armour

On SR4A p162 it states that _positive AP_ (raising the armour's effectiveness) is ineffective if the target is not wearing armour.
I am modifying that very slightly to patch a loophole which makes no sense to me, for situations when the target is very lightly armoured.
Here is the replacement rule.

> The effect of positive AP cannot be greater than doubling the defender's armour.
> This takes into account all applicable armour before AP is applied.
> This applies also if the defender has no armour; double zero is still zero.

For example a character with 2 ballistic armour is shot with flechettes: AP +5. Their effective armour is 4 and not 7; the extra three points of positive AP are ineffective.
Another example; a troll which has titanium bone lacing, wearing a leather jacket has an effective ballistic armour of 4 before AP is applied.  That's 1 from being a troll, 1 from the bone lacing and 2 from the jacket.  This troll is shot with flechettes: AP +5 and their effective armour for resisting the damage is 8, not 9.
