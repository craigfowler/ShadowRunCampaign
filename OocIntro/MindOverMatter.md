# Mind Over Matter

I have permitted the Mind Over Matter Adept power for use. This is originally printed in the book [War!], page 178. Here's the text of that power:

> **Mind Over Matter**
> 
> Cost: 1.5 (may only be taken once)
> 
> The adept is truly a master of mind over matter and may use one Mental attribute in place of one Physical attribute for any tests.
> 
> The attributes used must correspond per the Astral Attributes table (p. 192, SR4A); for example, only Charisma may be used in place of Strength, only Logic for Agility, etc. Once the attribute substitution is chosen for this power, it cannot be changed.
