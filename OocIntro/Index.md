# OOC Intro

_This isn't final yet!  If you're a player reading this before I've announced it then it's still subject to change!_

This is what you need to know out-of-character for Craig's gang-level ShadowRun game.
The info you need as a new player is that we are using [ShadowRun 4th Anniversary Edition rules] along with its five major expansion rulebooks.
This is a _gang level_ game with [a much lower power level than a normal ShadowRun game], so adjust your expectations accordingly!
To create gang level characters, use [these adjustments to the character creation rules].

[ShadowRun 4th Anniversary Edition rules]: Rules.md
[a much lower power level than a normal ShadowRun game]: PowerLevel.md
[these adjustments to the character creation rules]: CharacterCreation.md

## Sample characters

As an example of what I expect from characters in this game, I have created three sample characters.
These demonstrate the level of power I'm expecting from starting characters in this game; these would all be perfectly viable in this campaign.
In fact, if you'd like to play one of them, with or without some customisations of your own, then go ahead!  Just be sure to coordinate with the other players to make sure that you don't both grab the same one.

* [A human shaman](Shaman.md)
* [An ork rigger](Rigger.md)
