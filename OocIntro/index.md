# Out-of-character introduction

This is what you need to know out-of-character for Craig's gang-level ShadowRun game.
I will be using [ShadowRun 4th Anniversary Edition rules] along with its five major expansion rulebooks.
I'm also using [these **house rules**].
This is a _gang level_ game with [a much lower power level than a normal ShadowRun game], so adjust your expectations accordingly!
To create gang level characters, use [these adjustments to the character creation rules].

You will all begin the game [as lieutenants of a street gang].
All of the members of the party should begin the first session knowing one another.
It is also assumed that pre-campaign you have gone on some small missions together before.
Within the gang, you're _the team who get things done_ when there's something that's too risky or important to send regular goons.

## Sample characters

As an example of what I expect from characters in this game, I have created three sample characters.
These demonstrate the level of power I'm expecting from starting characters; these examples would all be perfectly viable in this campaign.
In fact, if you'd like to play one of them, with or without some customisations of your own, then go ahead!  Just be sure to coordinate with the other players to make sure that you don't both grab the same one.
