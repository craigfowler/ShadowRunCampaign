# Refreshing Edge

This is less a house rule and more some info to help set expectations.

Each mission I run is split into logical **scenes**. Each time the objectives of a scene are met, I will allow characters to refresh some of their edge. That might not be all of it, typically it will be half of your edge pool (round up).

That might not quite line up with game sessions; you might complete multiple scenes in a session or a long scene could span over a few sessions.

You can still regain Edge ad-hoc for exceptional reasons; see the bottom of SR4A page 74.
