# Karma & Nuyen trading

A house rule which I permit is the trading of Karma and Nuyen between party members, as characters progress.

## Why?

_The point of this rule_ is to help even out the way in which some characters need more Karma to buy up skills and abilities wheras some other characters need Nuyen to buy implants and gear.
You could imagine a shaman has very few uses for Nuyen (short of Power foci) but wants all of the Karma they can get.

I am implementing this as a "Trade between members of the party" scheme rather than "Trade with the GM".
FYI in a previous edition there was an official optional rule where PCs could trade with the GM.
I prefer trading between the party, to keep the overall levels of money/Karma stable.

## Details

* No character is under any obligation to participate in this rule.  It is 100% only with both players' consent that trades may be made.
* The actual trading is 100% performed out-of-character.  Even if you cheat or swindle or lie to another member of the party in-character, this trade must be conducted and handled OOC, so there is zero opportunity for dishonesty or unfair advantages.
* Players/characters may come up with any in-character explanation/description they please, or they may handwave it entirely in-character.
* All trading must be done via the Gamesmaster and are broadcast to the whole game group OOC.  That is, everyone playing will know out-of-character how much was traded and what the rate was, every time a trade occurs.
    * This to keep everyone honest.
* Players set their own going rates for this trade.  They could decide that ¥1,000 is traded for one Karma point, or ¥5,000 to a Karma point or at any rate they mutually agree upon.
    * _As Gamesmaster, I recommend one Karma to ¥2,500 as a fair rate.  This is the rate used in Runner's Companion in the optional rule on page 41._
    * Players may use any rate they wish though, by mutual agreement of everybody involved in the trade.
* Trades are one-player-to-another, no three-way or four-way trading is allowed.
