# Rules in-use

The rule books which are available to players for this game are as follows.
I've linked to Drive Thru RPG for these but I'm not endorsing them as a store; that's just an easy way to unambiguously link to the right book.
For example the name "Runner's Companion" has been reused across many game editions; you don't want to be trying to use the wrong one.
If you did want to buy them, this [discounted bundle for all of the expansion books] might be of interest.

* [ShadowRun 4th "Anniversary Edition" Core rulebook]
    * I'll be referring to this as **SR4A**
    * This is the only mandatory rulebook, others are strictly optional
* [Unwired]
    * Computers & hacking expansion
* [Arsenal]
    * Guns, vehicles & equipment expansion
    * Also has some expanded combat rules
* [Augmentation]
    * Implants, cyberware, bioware, nanotech
    * Much of this will be out of reach to your characters
* [Street Magic]
    * Magic expansion
* [Runner's Companion]
    * Other assorted expansion & optional rules
    * Where it comes to optional rules, right now I'm not using any of them
    * If you'd like to use one, ask first

_Don't worry if you have regular 4th Edition versions_ of these books.
The updated versions for SR4A are 99% reprints of the original SR4 versions with errata already-included.
