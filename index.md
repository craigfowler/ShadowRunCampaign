# Player materials

Everything on this site is for players to read.
There's nothing _secret_ here; I have that in a separate set of notes which are not published.

For starters I suggest you read the **[out-of-character intro]** which talks about the rules we're using, the type of game and the character creation process.
You should also read the **[in-character intro]** which tells you more about the shared character background and the setting.
