# The Crimson Crush

The Crimson Crush (sometimes shorted to just "The Crush") are a gang operating in Redmond, Seattle.
Initially they were a purely ork gang, focussed on anti-racism, the kind who would counter-protest the Humanis Policlub, or even get involved in street tussles.
Since then they have expanded a little and are into activities such as selling BTLs and extortion.
They also admit members of other races now.

The [Foundry Brothers] began their existence as an offshoot of The Crush.
Relations between the gangs is not good and members are always hostile to one another.
