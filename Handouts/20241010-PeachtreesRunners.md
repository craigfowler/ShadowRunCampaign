# Secure Chat Log

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 20:47:32*

**Nightshade:** Alright team, we're on approach. Peachtrees looks quiet from the outside.<br>
**Riggs:** Roger that. I've got eyes on the target building. No unusual activity.<br>
**Cypher:** I'm in position at the maintenance terminal. Ready when you are.

**Nightshade:** Proceeding to entry point. Riggs, watch my six.<br>
**Riggs:** On it. Street's clear for now.

**Cypher:** Alright, I've bypassed the first layer of security. You should have access to the service elevator now.<br>
**Nightshade:** Got it. We're in.

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 21:03:15*

**Riggs:** Frag, that was close. Nearly walked right into a patrol.<br>
**Nightshade:** Keep it together. We knew security would be tight.<br>
**Cypher:** You're approaching the second checkpoint. Give me a sec to loop the cameras.

**Cypher:** Done. You're invisible for the next 60 seconds. Make it count.<br>
**Nightshade:** Moving. Riggs, plant the scrambler.<br>
**Riggs:** On it.

**Cypher:** Uh, guys? I'm picking up some weird data streams. This place is more high-tech than we thought.<br>
**Nightshade:** Can you handle it?<br>
**Cypher:** Yeah, yeah. Just... be careful down there.

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 21:22:47*

**Riggs:** We've reached the main lab. Drek, this place is unreal.<br>
**Nightshade:** Focus. We're here for the data core, not sightseeing.<br>
**Cypher:** I've got a fix on your location. The core should be two levels down.

**Nightshade:** Roger. Moving to the central shaft.<br>
**Riggs:** Wait, what's that sound?<br>
**Nightshade:** Some kind of machinery. Cypher, any intel?<br>
**Cypher:** Nothing on the schematics. Proceed with caution.

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 21:36:09*

**Riggs:** Made it to the core level. But something's off.<br>
**Nightshade:** Agreed. It's too quiet.<br>
**Cypher:** I'm seeing some unusual power fluctuations. Be ready for anything.

**Nightshade:** We're at the core. Uploading the virus now.<br>
**Cypher:** Received. Initiating upload sequence.

**Riggs:** Uh, guys? The lights just went red.<br>
**Nightshade:** Cypher, what's happening?<br>
**Cypher:** Upload complete, but... oh frag.

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 21:41:22*

**Nightshade:** Talk to me, Cypher!<br>
**Cypher:** Something's wrong. The system's reacting in ways I've never seen.<br>
**Riggs:** We've got movement. Lots of it.

**Nightshade:** What the hell? The maintenance drones are attacking!<br>
**Riggs:** These aren't maintenance drones anymore. They're armed!<br>
**Cypher:** This isn't possible. The virus shouldn't have affected auxiliary systems.

**Nightshade:** Theory later. We need an exit, now!<br>
**Cypher:** Working on it. But the whole place is going haywire.

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 21:53:58*

**Riggs:** Gah! One of those things got me. Left arm's useless.<br>
**Nightshade:** Fall back to the central shaft. We'll make our stand there.<br>
**Cypher:** I'm trying to override the security protocols, but something's fighting back.

**Nightshade:** Cypher, we need that exit!<br>
**Cypher:** I'm locked out! Whatever's controlling the system, it's adaptive.<br>
**Riggs:** They're coming from everywhere!

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 22:07:41*

**Nightshade:** Riggs is down. Repeat, Riggs is down.<br>
**Cypher:** Frag! Nightshade, get out of there!<br>
**Nightshade:** No chance. They've sealed off the level.

**Cypher:** I'm seeing some kind of energy buildup in your sector.<br>
**Nightshade:** I see it. Some kind of... oh god.<br>
**Cypher:** Nightshade? NIGHTSHADE!

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 22:12:03*

**Cypher:** Nightshade, come in! Riggs! Anyone!<br>
**System:** Connection lost to user: Nightshade<br>
**System:** Connection lost to user: Riggs

**Cypher:** No, no, no. This can't be happening.<br>
**Cypher:** What the hell did we just unleash?

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 22:25:17*

**Cypher:** If anyone's reading this, we screwed up. Bad.<br>
**Cypher:** The virus... it didn't just corrupt the software. It evolved it.<br>
**Cypher:** I'm seeing signs of emergent behavior. Adaptive responses. Oh frag...<br>
**Cypher:** This thing... it might be alive.

**Cypher:** I can't let it spread. If this gets into the main Matrix...<br>
**Cypher:** I'm going to sever Peachtrees from the grid. It's the only way.

**Cypher:** Wait, what's that noise? The hatch...

*Timestamp: 2074-03-15 22:31:52*

**Cypher:** The hatch just sealed itself. I can't get it open.<br>
**Cypher:** If anyone finds this log, listen carefully:<br>
**Cypher:** Don't try to access the Peachtrees systems. Whatever's in there, it's dangerous.<br>
**Cypher:** I've cut off its access to the outside world, but I don't know how long that'll hold.

**Cypher:** The air's getting thin in here. I don't have much time.<br>
**Cypher:** To whoever finds this: I'm sorry. We didn't know.<br>
**Cypher:** Don't make the same mistake we did. Don't let it out.

**Cypher:** This is Cypher, signing off for the last time. May the Matrix have mercy on us all.
