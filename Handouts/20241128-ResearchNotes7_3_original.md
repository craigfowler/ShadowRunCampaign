Significant setbacks in our Genetic Vector Necrolysis (GVN) protocol. The quantum-coherent targeting algorithm is demonstrating critical instability when integrated with the Morphogenic Dissolution Protocol (MDP).

Preliminary test results reveal a catastrophic divergence in nano-construct behavior. While individual components function perfectly in isolation, their combined interaction produces unpredictable molecular cascades. The genetic targeting mechanism begins to degrade rapidly when exposed to the decomposition matrix, causing complete system failure in 87% of our experimental trials.

Key issues:

1. Quantum recognition matrix becomes unstable under MDP activation conditions
2. Genetic specificity drops to less than 12% accuracy during molecular dissolution
3. Nano-construct structural integrity compromised by cross-protocol interactions

Our primary hypothesis—that we could create a perfectly targeted, completely untraceable nano-assassination vector—now appears fundamentally flawed. The technological synergy we anticipated remains frustratingly out of reach.
