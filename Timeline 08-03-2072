We were summoned by Sylvie to Foundry Bro's HQ without hints as to what we were needed for.

Word among the Brothers is that a Crusher(Member of The Crimson Crush) was taken in trussed like a turkey.

Upon Arriving, the group are directed to a darkened room where Sylvie the (forget her 2nd name and race) leader of the FB and Pascal Tutericci (a lieutenant of equal standing to us) are standing over a hooded figure bound to a sturdy chair.
