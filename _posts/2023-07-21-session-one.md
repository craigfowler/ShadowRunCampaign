# Game session 20th July 2023

In-universe date: 8th March 2072

We were summoned by [Sylvie] to [the Foundry Brothers] HQ without hints as to what we were needed for.
Word among the Brothers is that [a Crusher] was taken in trussed like a turkey.

## The interrogation

Upon Arriving, the team are directed to a darkened room where Sylvie, leader of the FB, and [Pascal Turturici]
 are standing over a hooded figure bound to a sturdy chair.

Sylvie takes the team to a side room to brief them about how the hooded figure was caught.
There had been a brief rumble, started by [Hodei Mota] provoking FB members with threats to the whole of the FB.

Whilst this occurs, Buddy goes wobbly eyed; he has watcher spirits scan Pascal, Sylvie and Hodei.
Black spots are found on auras of Pascal and Hodei, nothing mentioned for S.
None are reported to be magically active.

The team are tasked with interrogating Hodei.
They return to the holding area to find Pascal had removed the hood and was beating the prisoner.
Hal calmly stepped in and took over the interrogation.
Pascal was unhappy but knew it was orders and stepped back.

Hal started to question in an unthreatening manner.
Gunshow stood behind the prisoner so closely his breath could probably be felt.
Glitch stayed in the other room to engage in mighty battle with Hodei's commlink, occasionally listening to the interrogation via comms.

Two epic battles; one of words (and a little menace) the other of Technomantic hide and seek took place.
Hal's instinct for people gave him the advantage and using Hodei's boastful nature got him to admit there would be an attack that would _"Hit the FB in the belly, really put you down and we'll get our turf back."_ and also that he would be a strike leader with some goons during the event.
He also mentioned there was an inside man in the FB aiding the attack.

At a point during the interrogation Buddy made an impatient noise and waved a hand imperiously but nothing happened except he was mocked by Hodei.
_Buddy suffered a 6-hour loss of his magical abilities, beginning at roughly noon, for breaking his code of conduct._

Meanwhile, Glitch had struggled to gain mastery of Hodei's comm, it seeming almost as contrary as the orc that carried it.
Glitch gained the intel that Hodei would be the leader of roughly 50 lightly armed goons.
This attack was only be one part/prong the of the action that Hodei mentioned.
Glith also determined that all of the attacks would be against a single target.

Unfortunately neither Hodei nor the commlink had information which indicated what the target was actually to be, only the date.
That would be **Friday 11th**, three days hence.

### Paydata!

Also, on Hodei's commlink, Glitch found some paydata which indicated the details of an upcoming BTL sale being conducted by the Crimson Crush.
Whilst this is irrelevant to the mission at hand, it has a value to those who might want to interfere with The Crush.
Glitch sold this data he found and spread the wealth: **¥26 to each member** of the team.

## Deducing the nature of the attack

Feeling that he had milked Hodei for everything relevant Hal contacts Sylvie.

* To pass on the results
* Ask how they should dispose of the stroppy orcboy
* To enquire if she knew any likely targets for such a strike that fit the bill

The team were pointed to some Long serving FB members who could answer that last question.

After having secured Hodei once more, Dominic set a motion detecting RFID and a mini drone on watch.
The team moved to speak with the FB members that Sylvie had recommended.

### Speaking with Pascal Turturici

The first member of the Foundry Brothers that the team speak to is Pascal.
He offered the Free Market at the corner of New Prosperity & 9th and Industry way, the local Stuffer Shack and the New Prosperity Monorail Station.
The party felt none of these likely as the Free Market wasn't open for trade on a Friday and the other two had an amount of Corporate protection and wouldn't greatly affect the FB.

### Speaking with Morgan Gallegos

[Morgan Gallegos] offered Geng kuai geng kuai de kafei, Fuhrmann Automotive and the Fenghuang trading estate is a small shopping mall, now independently run and managed.
The first was low chance due to partial corp ownership and not really matching target parameters.
Fuhrmann is borderline as it's close to HQ and heavily fortified so a lightly armed group would be slaughtered unless the inside man had access to security and even then the FB would be close to hand.
Fenghuang was eliminated due to lack of income or real threat to FB by its loss.

### Speaking with Kleopatra Nicolaidou

[Kleopatra Nicolaidou] offered Doc Chung's Surgery, Kuàilè zūn yú Soy processing plant, Macdonald and Sons Protien Farm and Albin's Bar, which is open 24/7.
Doc Chungs was eliminated as he provides to all comers neutrally.
Kuàilè zūn yú Soy is semi corp, only really serves New Prosperity, is barely guarded and in signal dead zone so our top pick.
McD's is run by armed FB and well protected.
As for Albin's ...

Upon the Bar being mentioned Gunshow made a phone call to the Bar to find Albin wasn't available.
A meeting & room were available at 7pm today (08-03-2072) for a face-to-face visit.
