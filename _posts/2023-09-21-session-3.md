08/03/2072 late night at the soy plant.

Having spoken with Yin Tsao the shift foreman and Cecelia the Admin and assessed the circumstances somewhat the crew began to take action.

Dom considered the busted fire door and after thinking through several courses of action decided simply repairing the lock would best serve.(got paid for the repair)

Glitch reenters the companys local system and while finding no net access or sabotage by Rebecca Weiss there is a record of her physical comings and going throughout the plant. Being thorough he continues for other evidence to find the Flavour suppliers had dropped over the last 6 months to one, Deke's Amino Composites. Additionally he found the insurance company Trubek, Isek & Sons had been attempting to contact Cecilia regarding a current policy investigations. There was also a work order for gas pipe corrosion repair on site that was apparently 2 weeks from being carried out.

Fella chose to summon the ghost of dairy maids past and asked her to point out non allied spirits and awakened folks. Apparently there was a worker present that had the potential but had no training or conscious use of magic.

Hal exits the plant to recheck lines of approach on all fronts.

Gunshow re-inspects the reception area for strengths and vulnerabilities before deciding the crew would need something to use as a base for reinforcing or barricading. With this in mind(and not boredom and a need to smash things or pump iron) he prowls into the night for some recreational car scrapping returning shortly with armfuls of sturdy roll bar/chassis bits which he dumps unceremoniously in front of Dom who is..

Dom, having fixed the door had moved on to see what else he could apply his magic toolkit too. Inspecting the front shutters with the hope it could be dropped entirely and used as a barrier against the expected mob of CC he found it rather well attached to the wall above. While doing this inspection he did however spot an open broken pipe that he examined and traced to a nearby control panel with a DO NOT USE! sign on a particular section. Knowing the system and applying his skill he discovered the labelled panel would release a fair amount of boiling soy over large portions of the loading area.

The crew have a conference call/meeting to brainstorm a plan of attack and share info. Fella brings up his reasoning for calling and asking the Spirit of Julie Andrews about awakened folks. This nudged Glitch and Gunshows memory who listed the dozen or so known magic users in the CC.  All of which are of equivalent rank to their own or higher. Hal decides to speak to Cecilia RE the insurers Email and failing flavour supply contracts. As the crew talk about this they realise the three pronged attack was three methods rather than three waves of CC goons.

Hal speaks to Cecilia about the Email (she was ignorant of it due to it going to her spam folder) and she agrees to arrange a meeting for the next day. He also asks about the flavour suppliers which she explains was due to a bankruptcy and a discontinued contract due to lack of profit leaving Dekes' as sole supplier for their whole range of product flavours.

The Crew leave for HQ to get some sleep(except for Fella) and report to Sylvie. Hal takes some time to peruse the insurance documents in order to prep for the planned meeting.

Morning comes and Hal gets a message that Syvlie is unavailable and that one of her advisers already in the loop will do. Hal tries all three and Kleopatra Nikoladue replies in a conferemce call informing him that Sylvie is unavailable due to some high level drinking that occurred the previous night (cut to a bed with a fully clothed Sylie sprawled and heavily snoring under a mass of bedding.). Kleo asks what the crew need (Gunshow says Ammo but is ignored). They are offered 5 green FB members. 

Moving onwards The Crew split. Hal and Glitch collect Cecilia and head for the Insurers offices in Renton (hi end district) Dom heads to The Soy plant with Fella and Gunshow opts to get more ammo...cos more is betterer before joining them at the Plant.

The car ride to Renton is peaceful as any rich area would be as Glitch takes the time to take a nap and break into Cecilias' comm to make sure she was on the level. All good as far as he can tell. Upon arrival Hal, Glitch and Cecelia find the case worker, an Orcgirl by the name of Monica in something mkre than a cubicle but less than an office. Glitch sits outside while Hal and Cecelia introduce themselves and begin negotiations. Hal applies his expertise in the business/corporate world to smooth the way and open lines of enquiry causing Monice to let slip there had been an anonymous tip RE The Soy Plants various infractions against the insurer's requirements for cover. Hal flashes Glitch asking him to find the letter on the local comm net. Hal spins the contract, some words and a convincing handshake in such a way that Monica is convinced to sandbag the investigation. Glitch uses the moment to stealthily attempt a hack on Monica's comm. He's detected and Monica simply turns off access to her comm looking suspiciously at Hal for a moment before continuing their parting words.

Dom having got to the Plant with Fella began repairs to the corroded gas lines using the materials Gunshow had harvested the nigh before and completed it to a professional standard (got paid)

Gunshow pulled up some time later and spent a moment checking the approaches for change and signs of preparation of lines of attack. Entering the plant he did a walk around inside and casually noticed the Rigger attachments on the forklifts "Ain't dat like der fing you plug in yer drones?" he says to Dom, who looks like a fella that has new toys.

Returning to the barrens, Hal, Glitch and Cecilia decide to speak on the subject of flavour suppliers and that they should speak with Dekes' to be sure they would and could continue to supple the Plant with all the additives they could want. Cecilia agrees and immediately attempts to start a conference call with Dekes' to find it won't connect. No net, no call, no text. As though Dekes' had gone utterly Comm dead.

Hal contacts the Crew and gets them all heading the same way before calling Sylvie with a warning (probably the three advisors too if he gets no reply)

What's happened at Dekes? Will the 5 gang members be if any use? will Gunshow get to express some rage in violent and unhealthy ways? Should Dom quit the gang, get his certs and become a service engineer? tune in in two weeks!
