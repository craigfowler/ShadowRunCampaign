In-universe date: 8th March 2072 (afternoon/evening)

## Deducing the nature of the attack

Having shortlisted a group of likely [Crimson Crush] targets the group have a quick chat with [Sylvie] on [Hodei's] fate. 
Sylvie vetoes killing him _(with a quiet disappointed noise from [Gunshow])_ but she also recognised he needed isolating.
Sylvie promised to arrange a somewhat unpleasant 2 weeks for him.
After some discussion it was decided to inspect the likely targets A.S.A.P.

### McDonald & Sons Protein Farm

Cruising to the protein farm the group easily gain entry into the [Foundry Brothers-run] farm and go to work.
[Glitch] dives the in-house network for clues to any hint of scouting on camera footage, cyber attacks or implanted malware.

[Dom] did a full mechanical inspection of the facility. Having found no sign of sabotage but seeing signs of imminent failure in some areas he informs the shift leader who is impressed enough to flash some cred his way (500¥).

[Halthir] and Gunshow meanwhile had checked the facility perimeter for lines of stealthy approach and decide to canvass the nearby apartment block.
Noting the locals were a tad wary of an armoured Troll with an AK, Hal asked Gunshow to wait outside while he does the posh chat.
Finding a local resident Hal finds no evidence of Crimson Crush infiltration or invasion but he did find there were a couple of Elven independent Novacoke dealers working the area which Hal reported to Sylvie.

Meanwhile, left to his own devices for a moment, Gunshow decides to scout the stealthy lines of approach he spotted as they'd pulled in.
He found them well used by locals but nothing pointing to Crusher presence.
Looking up he sees one of Doms drones flying a higher and wider check and so he turns to rejoin Hal.
Feeling they'd done all they could, they moved on to [Albin's].

### Albin's bar

Pulling in to the secure parking area. Dom noticed cameras and [Fella] noted a rather well secured building and decided he needed some watcher spirits to watch his back in such a relatively crowded place.
Having arrived more than an hour early the crew took the chance to drop some cred on a decent meal. Gunshow went to town ordering the finest they had blowing 25 cred and taking his time to enjoy it.

Time came for the meeting, temp passcode were sent for the room and the crew entered the inner regions of Albins finding it more richly decorated the further they went.
Coming to the door most of the crew took a chair whilst Gunshow strode right up to Albin's shiny shiny desk to give him an  appropriate (for Gunshow) warning of the possible attack.
Albin thought at first it was a possible threat then a shakedown attempt before realising the crew really did just want to warn him.

Albin laughed off the misunderstanding and dismissed his unseen hit team, who appeared from the walls like chameleons.
Gunshow was rather distracted for a moment by the effect, before they left through a secret door.

Albin then sent the crew his contact details as a reward for their actions and reasons for same. _[Albin Vacatello] is a new contact for everyone in the team; loyalty 1, connection unknown._

Gunshow looked puzzled at that for a moment then left for the bar as Hal and Albins did an amount of polite goodbyes. The crew picked him up on the way out and after some discussion decided to immediately drive on to.

### Kuàilè zūn yú Soy processing plant

As the crew approached [the plant] at 10pm it was easy to see that the interior was open and well lit.
Workers could be seen from a distance and Dom could tell from some distance that the shutters hadn't been closed in some time.
Furthermore, the crew could see a functional but puny reception door to the right of the loading bay and along the left side of the building a row of fire doors.

Pulling up and entering with minimal reaction from workers the crew start the inspection.
Dom saw an awful lot of jury-rigging in most of the building in an effort to keep the neglected plant running, the shutter doors were beyond repair and nearly everything in the factory was obsolete and impossible to get proper parts for.
Gunshow went to check the fire doors. Three were relatively solid but the fourth and furthest from reception and the shutters had a broken lock.

### Speaking with the foreman

Meanwhile, Halthir had gotten a worker to call the foreman down.
The daytime foreman is a human male named [Yin Qiao] who asked what the crew wanted and reminded them the plant had paid protection already.
Finding that the crew were here to inspect and maybe improve the plant, he called [Cecylia Kasprzak] before inviting the crew into his office to check files.

Hal talked Yin into giving his access codes for the system and Glitch set to work.
Knowing it takes a moment to pore over files, Gunshow inspected the walkway and looked for roof access; he found none and that the walkways are solid.
He returned in time for the interesting bit of the files which had pictures.

The most interesting picture was of an orc girl named [Rebecca Weiss], it had the wrong name and said she was a security guard for a week but Gunshow and Dom knew she was a Crusher. This makes the Soy plant clear favourite for the attack and it may as well be a bloody sieve for defensive purposes.

The crew have two full days to plot, plan and ready a defence for the Friday showdown. Gunshow scouts about for and abandoned vehicle while having a ponder.
