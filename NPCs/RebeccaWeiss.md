# Rebecca Weiss

Rebecca Weiss (her surname pronounced like _Vice_) is an orc member of [The Crimson Crush].

Records show that she has been working for a few weeks at [the Kuàilè zūn yú] before abruptly quitting.
Whilst she was working under a false name at the time, investigation of personnel records by [Glitch], along with [Gunshow] and [Dom]'s knowledge of Seattle gangs, identified her from a photograph.

She had good access to the processing plant and would have had ample opportunity to scout it out for an attack.
